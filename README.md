This README is specifically for running the StreamLit app, `NewMovMie_App.py`.

## Step 0: Setting Up Your Environment
Begin by downloading all of the files from the team's project repository onto your machine. Open the entire project folder in an IDE of your choice. Run the `requirements.txt` file in the project repository by copy and pasting the command: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 1: Running the App
In your terminal, run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run NewMovMie_App.py
```
The app will open and run in your default browser. 

## Step 2: Enjoy!
The app consists of three pages: landing, collaborative filtering interactive plot, and hybrid model interactive plot. Happy interacting!
