for the project New MovMie. It contains three pages: a landing
page, an interactive display of the collaborative filtering
ratings, and an interactive plot of the hybrid model.

        ##### About New MovMie:

        New MovMie */noo moov-mee/* is a recommendation system designed to provide you with a movie recommendation (i.e. a "New Movie for Me").
        It is so easy, especially with the current resigned acceptance around doomscrolling and phone addiction,
        to sit back and say 'whatever, it doesn't matter'. But being trapped in an echo chamber and never hearing
        new perspectives is scientifically proven to be depressing and lonely and isolating.
        While this project is specifically geared for long-form media (movies), we hope that it will spark an interest
        in a New Mov(M)ie. Even if it doesn't, we're proud of you for trying.

        ##### Technical Overview:

        We combined collaborative filtering (CF) and a multi-layer perceptron model (MLP)
        to create these unique, 'you-will-probably-like-this-but-we're-not-totally-sure' ratings.
        
        Our *CF method* used a k-value of 3 and the cosine similarity metric to predict ratings.
        
        Our *MLP method* had one hidden layer of 10 nodes, a step size of 0.1, loss function MSE,
        the ReLU activation function (hidden), and the sigmoid activation function (output).
        
        The combined, *Hybrid Model* used the generated datsets of user | movie | rating from CF 
        and MLP, extracted the movies a user hasn't rated and the corresponding CF & MLP scores,
        then evaluated the scores, returning the movie with the highest CF for the lowest MLP.

        * What it means:
            * **Tall green bar**: the CF rating is higher than the MLP rating
                * *Why is this good?* It means others similar to the User liked the movie more than was anticipated by the MLP.
            * **High blue line**: the CF rating is high
                * *Why is this good?* High collaborative filtering scores indicate the user will likely enjoy the movie.
            * **Relatively low orange line**: the MLP rating is relatively low
                * *Why is this good?* Low MLP rating scores indicate that the user would likely not pick that movie on their own.
